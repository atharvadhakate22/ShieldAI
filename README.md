# 🛡️ ShieldAI – Real-Time AI-Powered Intrusion Detection & Prevention

In today’s internet-driven world, **safeguarding network infrastructure against malicious activities** is more crucial than ever. **ShieldAI** is a real-time **cyber threat detection and prevention system** that leverages machine learning and AI to **detect, classify, and block cyberattacks** as they happen — directly from live network traffic.

**CICIDS2017** Dataset : ShieldAI’s AI models are trained and validated using the CICIDS2017 dataset, a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark dataset for intrusion detection systems. This dataset contains labeled network traffic with realistic benign and attack scenarios such as DDoS, brute force, port scans, and SQL injection, making it ideal for training machine learning models in cybersecurity.

- 🚨 DDoS Attacks  

Using **Scapy** for live packet sniffing and **FastAPI** for the backend, the system extracts **71+ features** per packet and feeds them into a **pre-trained Autoencoder and Deep Neural Network (DNN)** model to detect anomalies and predict threats such as:

- ⚠️ Port Scans  
- 🔑 Brute Force Logins  
- 🛠️ SQL Injections  
- ...and more.

Threat predictions are streamed in real-time to a **React-based dashboard**, allowing users to monitor and visualize threats dynamically. For active defense, **malicious IPs are automatically blocked** using **WinDivert** at the OS level.

> ShieldAI enhances proactive cybersecurity by offering a local, intelligent, and scalable defense system for modern network environments.

## 🔥 Key Features

- 🧠 **AI-Based Detection** (Autoencoder + DNN)
- 📦 **Live Packet Sniffing** (Scapy)
- ⚙️ **Backend**: FastAPI with async real-time pipelines
- 📈 **Frontend**: React.js with WebSocket & Chart.js visualization
- 🛡️ **Automatic IP Blocking**: WinDivert-based filtering

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Packet Capture**: Scapy captures packets in real-time.
2. **Feature Extraction**: 71 custom features are extracted from each packet (Xgboost).
3. **Threat Prediction**: Features are passed into a trained AI model (Autoencoder + DNN).
4. **Visualization**: Predictions are streamed to the frontend.
5. **Prevention**: If an attack is detected, the source IP is blocked instantly.
